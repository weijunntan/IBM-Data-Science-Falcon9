# IBM Data Science Capstone Course
This repository is the final project for IBM Data Science Course at Coursera. It  will apply your data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company which is SpaceX in this project.    

As a starting point of almost all data science projects, it need to collect data, as much and relevant as possible.

I will be collecting data from various sources. After the raw data has been collected, I will need to improve the quality by performing data wrangling. 

Then can start exploring the processed data.  I get to practice my SQL skills as we query the data and gather insights.  

Also gain further insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization, I'll be able to see directly how variables might be related to each other.   

We'll drill down into finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in  data.  

Build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights.
